# hello-world
A repository to experiment with the functions of GitHub and test its features.

Carson here, I enjoy working with imbedded systems in C/C++. I also enjoy learning about machine learning and AI, and how to apply them to solve real world problems that exist in programming. There are many more things I enjoy as well, but that is a few. 

I also love skiing and kayaking in my free time.
